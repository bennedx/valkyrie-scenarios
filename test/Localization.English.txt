The list includes a special knife, a chalice, a human skull, some religious icons, and a number of herbs.

This page talks about an incantation that begins manifesting the portal in the sacrifice.

As you read further, the book discusses affixing the elder sign to the portal to stabilize it and hold it open. There is a also something about feeding the elder sign with additional sacrifice, but it isn't clear to you what that means. The book describes the artifact in great detail and how it is used in the ritual. A picture clearly shows what it looks like. The incantation itself is in the same language as the other two. You wonder if your father knew what he was talking about in the front of the book. Gain 2 {clue} the first time you read this page.\n\nYou'll keep an eye out as you wander the house.

The preferred date and time for the ritual is also discussed, with a full moon being the most important.\n\nIn the margin are notes about a place under the house that aligns with a ley line; there is also a list of years that would be good for the ritual.\n\nFinally, there is a paragraph about the importance of the {c:QItemElderSign}; if it cannot be used, the portal will not stabilize and will require constant, low-level sacrifice to remain open.\n

This first part will weaken it. Even if the second half of the ritual is not completed, the portal will eventually collapse.\n\nSealing the portal will prevent another from being opened near the same location. We want to complete this ritual.\n\nWhen you get to the incantation, you realize it is written in the same language as the blessing.

Most of them want to bring their god to Earth. 10 years ago, my father cast a ritual to summon It. He opened a portal. The power it possessed was breathtaking and I was powerless to stop it. Somehow, Father summoned local townsfolk through the portal to protect his work, even after he was dead. As the portal, I could feel people and monsters approaching and passing through me from the other side.”\n

EventJournalReadPage1Base.text,\n25 October 1925\n\nI’ve decided to record what happens this week. After three generations of Smythes making the attempt, I think the Master will finally bring Our God into this world. This time, there will be no mistakes. His uncle failed 10 years ago, but the Master will not. We are gathering supplies, preparing the altar, and looking for the right people to help us. We will sacrifice His son in the ritual. He says it is painful to think about--His son is so young--but that is what sacrifice is. The Master is a great man.\n

The Master told me in confidence the he yearns to stop, but that he must keep his commitment and see this through.\n\nThe boy has been moved to the dungeon outside the altar room. There is a hole in the wall that he stares through when he's not begging or screaming. The altar is visible through the hole; looking at it terrifies the boy. I can no longer hear him, but I can feel his fear from across the town. I will be strong.\n

He said something has changed, like there is another power in the house. My brethren have combed the house and can find nothing. I hope the Master is wrong.\n\nThe woman who lost the stone is already at the altar. Her husband pleaded with me to help him find the stone, so I'm going to search the chapel one more time. For his sake, I hope we find it.\n\nThe cleaning crew are due here momentarily. They will be here until they are... needed. The plan is set in motion.\n
