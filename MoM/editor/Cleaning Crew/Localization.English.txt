You were excited for the opportunity to see the inside of the house--and you can use the money your friend offered--but now that you are here, you wonder if the job is really worth it.\n\nYou walk up the long drive, slowly passing by the front of the now-dilapidated mansion. Looking around the yard, you remember back 10 years when those three kids were found. Two had been strangled, but the third--Peter Smythe's daughter--had been burned beyond recognition. They'd been found in the backyard.\n\nAfter the murders, old Mr Smythe was never seen again, so the family decided to sell the estate. You'd laughed off rumors that the kids had never really left, but no buyer was interested in this place, so it  sat moldering for all these years.\n\nThe yard looks like it hasn't been tended since Mr Smythe disappeared... or maybe longer. The gardens are dry and withered, cobblestones upended and half-buried, and dead trees are strewn across the property. You cannot see through the windows for all the mud and bugs.\nYou hope the inside is cleaner than the outside but, if it were, you wouldn't be here. As you round the corner of the house, you look toward the backyard and nervously laugh to yourself for thinking you'll encounter a mess like those kids 10 years ago.|||

This page talks about an incantation that begins manifesting the portal in the sacrifice. The revulsion you feel steels your resolve to prevent this from happening again.\n\nWhen you get to the incantation, you realize it is written in the same language as the blessing. You think back to that margin scrawl and wonder if you'll be able to understand it later.\n

As you read further, the book discusses affixing the elder sign to the portal to stabilize it and hold it open. There is a also something about feeding the elder sign with additional sacrifice, but it isn't clear to you what that means. The book describes the artifact in great detail and how it is used in the ritual. A picture clearly shows what it looks like. The incantation itself is in the same language as the other two. You wonder if your father knew what he was talking about in the front of the book. Gain 2 {clue} the first time you read this page.\n\nYou'll keep an eye out as you wander the house. You must find this artifact before your uncle does if you are going to stop him. \n\nThe first time you read this, something falls out of the book as you turn the page:  gain the {c:QItemSpells} spell and 1 {clue}.\n

The preferred date and time for the ritual is also discussed, with a full moon being the most important.\n\nIn the margin are notes about a place under the house that aligns with a ley line; there is also a list of years that would be good for the ritual.\n\nFinally, there is a paragraph about the importance of the {c:QItemElderSign}; if it cannot be used, the portal will not stabilize and will require constant, low-level sacrifice to remain open.\n

With the portal open, many horrors could come through while you are trying to close it. You must be prepared. Read the book carefully and read it soon.”\n

EventJournalReadPage1Base.text,\n25 October 1925\n\nI’ve decided to record what happens this week. After three generations of Smythes making the attempt, I think the Master will finally bring Our God into this world. This time, there will be no mistakes. His uncle failed 10 years ago, but the Master will not. We are gathering supplies, preparing the altar, and looking for the right people to help us. We will sacrifice His son in the ritual. He says it is painful to think about--His son is so young--but that is what sacrifice is. The Master is a great man.\n

There is a hole in the wall that he stares through when he's not begging or screaming. The altar is visible through the hole; looking at it terrifies the boy.
